Pioneer is a space adventure game set in our galaxy at the turn of the 32nd
century.

The game is open-ended, and you are free to eke out whatever kind of
space-faring existence you can think of. Explore and trade between millions
of star systems. Turn to a life of crime as a pirate, smuggler or bounty hunter. 
Travel through the territories of various factions fighting for power, freedom 
or self-determination. The universe is whatever you make of it.

Pioneer is under constant development and has a friendly community of players,
modders and developers around it. We'd love for you to try it and make part of 
the galaxy your own!
